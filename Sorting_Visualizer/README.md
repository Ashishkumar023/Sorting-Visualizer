# Sorting Visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms through an interactive visual interface.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features

1. **Colored Representation of Steps Being Executed**:
    - **Blue**: Default state
    - **Yellow**: Elements being compared
    - **Red**: Elements identified as in the incorrect position and to be moved
    - **Green**: Elements in the correct position

2. **Controls for Visualizations**:
    1. **Speed of Visualization**: 5 speed levels to control the pace of the visualization.
    2. **Data Size**: Adjust the size of the data set being sorted.
    3. **Generation of New Data**: Randomly generate new data for sorting.

3. **Algorithm Complexity**:
    - Display the time and space complexity of the algorithm being visualized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have a web browser.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kethantummala/Sorting_Visualizer.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the list.
3. Use the controls to set the speed of visualization, data size, and to generate new data.
4. Click the 'Start' button to begin the visualization.
5. Observe the sorting process with color-coded steps and algorithm complexity details displayed.
